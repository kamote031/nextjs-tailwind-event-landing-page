                For children offers a lot of health benefits. It is human nature
                to touch as a way of showing love and affection. This touch
                stimulates the body in positive ways to help it grow and
                develop. Massage is beneficial at any age but because children
                are still developing it can be especially helpful for them.

                entire body. This is accomplished by rubbing the muscles with
                long gliding strokes in the direction of blood returning to the
                heart. But swedish massage therapy goes beyond relaxation.

                Help for your pregnancy aches and pains. Prenatal massage is a
                type that's similar to regular massage – it aims to relax tense
                muscles, ease sore spots, mprove circulation and mobility, and
                just make you feel good. But prenatal massage is also customized
                to the needs of pregnant women and their changing bodies, and
                therapists trained in prenatal massage adjust their techniques
                accordingly.
