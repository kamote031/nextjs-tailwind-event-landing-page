                For children offers a lot of health benefits. It is human nature
                to touch as a way of showing love and affection. This touch
                stimulates the body in positive ways to help it grow and

                long gliding strokes in the direction of blood returning to the
                heart. But swedish massage therapy goes beyond relaxation.
